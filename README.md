#  Python Learning Projects

This repository contains all the projects and mini-programs I've built while learning **Python**, including both **Pygame-based games** and **basic practice programs**. These helped me understand programming concepts, game development, and logic building.

These are full games built using the **Pygame** library. They focus on game loops, user interaction, graphics, and fun mechanics.

📂 All games are inside the `Games/` folder.
